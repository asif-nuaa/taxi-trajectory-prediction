## Model

Experimented in: Word2vec, K-means, Mean Shift clustering, Deep Learning

* Using k-means algorithm for clustering destination points.
* Using the word2vec model to embed each point in the map, datetime, and taxiId to a real numeric vector.
* Using multi-layer perceptron (Deep Learning) to predict the destination of the taxi trip to one of clusters.
* Using reduce_mean of points in the cluster to predict final destination of the taxi trip.
